This privacy policy governs your use of the software application Loggbok (“Application”). In this policy, you can read how we collect and use your information. 
**We do not process or store any data you have logged with Loggbok.**

# What information does Loggbok collect?
The latest version of the Application uses the third-party service [Microsoft AppCenter](https://appcenter.ms/) (Analytics and Diagnostics modules) to collect information about your windows device, crash reports and Application's usage metrics. Data policies regarding GDPR are detailed [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/gdpr/).

## Data Collected

The App Center SDKs used by Loggbok send data to App Center services. The data sent varies by the SDK/service and for the crash service, on the data handled by the Application. The usage of some services requires that certain data be sent in order for the service to function.

* **Application Secret (App-Secret)** A unique key used to identify the application.
* **Installation Identifier (Install-ID)** Each installation of an app with an App Center SDK results in a new, unique installation identifier. This ID is used to differentiate data from unique devices. App Center services require the ID to function properly.
* **Session Identifier** (sid) Analytics logs can be part of the same session by specifying this identifier.
* **User Identifier (userId)** An optional string used for associating logs with users
* **Timestamp (timestamp)** Log timestamp, example: '2017-03-13T18:05:42Z'
* **SDK Name (sdkName)** The name of the SDK. Consists of the name of the SDK and the platform, e.g. "appcenter.ios", "hockeysdk.android"
* **SDK Version (sdkVersion)** The version of the SDK in semver format, e.g. "1.2.0" or "0.12.3-alpha.1"
* **...** (The full list can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/sdk/data-collected).)

## Data Retention
Analytics and Diagnostics data retention will be limited to 28 days.  

# How we use the information?
We use the collected information in a variety of ways, including the following:

## Support*
We use the information to detect crashes within the Application, so that issues that may arise can be solved promptly and to provide you assistance when reporting problems.

## Improvements
We use the information to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our users, to improve the Application, and to develop new features and functionalities.

## License monitoring*
We use the information to check for license violations, e.g. a per-computer license file is used on more than one computer (regardless of whether the Application is used at different times or concurrently).

**\* Please note:  Microsoft Store Licenses: NO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IS USED. 
Other Licenses: Your user identifier (=license key or license file id) is included with the collected data. This personally identifiable information is necessary in order to provide you the service.**

# What choices do I have?
By using the Application, you are consenting to the collection of information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling the Application.

# Changes
We may revise this policy from time to time. You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes. By continuing to use Loggbok after those revisions become effective, you agree to the revised policy.
