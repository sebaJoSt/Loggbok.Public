Designed to work seamlessly with Arduino boards, LOGGBOK provides an easy and straightforward way to log data from a range of microcontrollers, including Atmega, ESP32, ESP8266 and others.
2:
Log all kind of data (sensors values, voltages, currents, temperatures) from your microcontroller.
3:
The Companion Arduino Libraries BLAECKSERIAL (Serial/USB) and BLAECKTCP (Ethernet/Wifi) are available through the Arduino Library Manager - a lot of examples included!
4:
Just connect your sensors to the board, install the companion Arduino Library, add the sensors in your Arduino sketch and upload it to the board...and start logging!
5:
Non-Cloud solution - All logging data is stored in a local SQLite database, providing you with a reliable solution for data storage, which is highly resistant to corruption.
6:
Monitor your sensor values with upper and lower limits.
7:
Events View and Email Notifications - Just enter the SMTP configuration of your email provider and get notified via email in case a sensor value goes off-limits or a logging error occurs.
